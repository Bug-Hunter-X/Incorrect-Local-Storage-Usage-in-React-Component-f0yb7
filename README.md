# Incorrect Local Storage Usage in React Component

This example demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the incorrect usage of `localStorage` within a React component.  The issue occurs due to improper handling of the `count` state and its interaction with `localStorage`. When the count is incremented, it is correctly stored in localStorage. However, if the count is decremented,  the logic does not update localStorage, causing the stored count to be stale and not reflect the current component state.

## Bug:

The `useEffect` hook only updates `localStorage` when `count` is greater than 0.  This means that decrementing the count will not update the stored value, leading to a discrepancy between the component's state and the persisted data in `localStorage`.

## Solution:

The solution involves updating `localStorage` regardless of whether the `count` is greater than 0. This ensures that the stored value always reflects the component's current state.
